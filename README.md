# Challenge 01- HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Description

A marketing agency wanted a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that the website will be optimized for search engines.

From this code refactor project, I learned about semantic HTML elements, a logical structure of elements, alt attributes for accessible and sequential order of heading attributes.
